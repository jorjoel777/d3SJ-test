# d3SJ-test
This test is meant to be the entrance to my Marfeel application.

Instructions:
Clone this repository into your local machine.

git clone https://github.com/jorjoel777/d3SJ-test.git

Index.html has the 3 graphs properly setup.

A total of 18 hours was used to create it.

SpecRunner.html will display failures as I didnÂ´t have the time to build my model around with Jasmine. 
It would require some extra time for me to adapt my model to Jasmine test environment.
